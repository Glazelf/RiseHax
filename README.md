# RiseHax  
This is a WIP save/memory editor for Monster Hunter: Rise for Nintendo Switch.
Check the [releases page](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/releases) for releases when this is ready for any public use. If you really want to test before then, build the source code yourself.  

## Risks
There is no easy way for us to test the ban risks of using this tool, especially online.  
For the first few months of the game being released we will have no proper indication of the risks either so use this tool fully at your own risk. If you do discover anything relevant to the risks of using this, please contact us either through [Discord](https://discord.gg/2gkybyu) or [a discussion](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/discussions) so we can document it for future reference.  
Pointers and offset data aren't publicly available in the source code, please use this tool and all the data that comes with it responsibly.
