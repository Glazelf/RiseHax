# RiseHax  
This is a WIP save/memory editor for Monster Hunter: Rise **for Nintendo Switch**.
Check the [releases page](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/releases) for releases and the [issues page](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/issues) for general progress.

## Risks
There is no easy way for us to thoroughly test the ban risks of using this tool, especially online.  
It doesn't seem like Capcom gives a shit about most forms of cheating, so this tool should be free to use.  
If you notice any bans please contact us either through [Discord](https://discord.gg/5NsYYuvm7D) or [a discussion](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/discussions) so we can document them for future reference.  

## How do use?
Refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/wiki) for usage handles.
