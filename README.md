# RiseHax
 
Please note that this code is currently non-functional as an actual save-editor of any kind.  
We are still doing research and experimenting with the demo's saves and memory offsets to try and get data from that and edit it.   
A lot of development will go into this before it will be usable on either the demo or the full game when it comes out.  
Check the [releases](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/releases) page for releases when this is ready.

Expect nothing and your expectations can only be positively met.
