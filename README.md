# RiseHax
Please note that since Monster Hunter: Rise hasn't been released yet, this editor wasn't made for it.  
Currently we are doing testing with live editing on the demo but there is no way for us to test save editing.  
Check the [releases](https://github.com/Glazelf/RiseHax/releases) page for releases when this is ready for any public use. If you really want to test before then, build the source code yourself.  
Expect nothing and your expectations can only be positively met.

## Risks
Since Monster Hunter: Rise isn't out yet and we don't work at Nintendo, there is no way for us to even guess the ban risks of using this tool, especially online.  
For the first few months of the game being released we will have no proper indication of the risks either so use this tool fully at your own risk.
